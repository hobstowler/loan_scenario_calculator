# Loan Scenario Calculator
## The Story
A couple of months ago, my wife and I were looking to buy a house and move back east to be closer to family. We were a little bit surprised to find how much the housing market had exploded nationwide since the last time we bought a house in 2016. I found myself creating a large and elaborate spreadsheet to model our financial situation and find out just how much house we could actually afford in this new market, but kept running into scalability issues. Google Sheets and MS Excel are powerful tool, but I was getting frustrated trying to tinker with parameters and get a clear picture of our cash flow under different scenarios.
So I started building this app...
Fast forward a few months, and my wife and I are getting settled into our new house in Virginia and I am, of course, still working on this app.
That's not to call this endeavor a failure, far from it. I've learned a lot about tkinter and Python while working with this app and the utility is still there. The only major thing that's changed is the initiating force behind this project, but there will be major changes in my life again before too long and I will once again need a way to model those changes.
